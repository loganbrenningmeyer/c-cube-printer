# Platonic Solids Printer

***Platonic solids*** are geometric solids whose faces are all equally-sized regular polygons which meet at equal angles at the vertices. There are only 5 Platonic solids: cube, tetrahedron, octahedron, icosahedron, and dodecahedron.

Using the code from the cube printer and with help from this paper (http://www.ms.uky.edu/~lee/visual05/notes/platonics.pdf), the vertices of every platonic solid can be derived from a cube. 

## Tetrahedron

By taking "every other" vertex of the cube (top diagonal/bottom diagonal), and connecting them you can create a tetrahedron.

## Octahedron

An octahedron can be formed by connecting the center of each of the cube's 6 faces.

## Icosahedron

Building an icosahedron from a cube is a bit trickier than the others. First, intersect 3 "golden rectangles"--rectangles whose ratio of length/width = $\phi$ (the golden ratio)--along the $x$, $y$, and $z$-axes. The length of the rectangles is equal to the length of the cube, and the width can be found by length/$\phi$. $alpha$
